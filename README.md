# DragonTracker9000
This is the as yet unamed dragon tracking application of Flight Rising user TheLegoLady.  

How to use this application:
Using command line Python with all files in the active directoy, do: python display.py
Use is pretty self explanatory so I won't bother explaining it right now.

In order for images to work, they need to be of the .gif type and in the active directory with all the files.  I need to fix that.
